Usages:

`python mac_changer.py -i eth0 -m 11:22:33:44:55:11`  
Note that this will screw up your MAC address / local environment. Restart VM to refresh it.

`python network_scanner.py -t 10.0.2.1/24`

`python arp_spoof.py`
Right now I have the target / gateway IPs hardcoded so check for that when you run this script. Run the Windows VM as well to see the effects of this script.
